# LSTM-based method for stock returns prediction

Team member:  Zhesheng Zhang  (individual)

Basic method:  In LSTM model for stock prediction, one sequence was defined as a sequential collection of the daily dataset of any single stock in a fixed time period (N days). The daily dataset describes the performance of the stock with sequence learning features like closing price, trade volume on one particular day in these N days.

Raw Data Set:   All A share stocks from 2004 Jan.2 to 2018 Jan.4 including open,close,high and low daily prices, trade volume and turnover rate.(It remains to be added and cleaned)

Brief plan:  By using LSTM, we plan to improve the stock return prediction accuracy by random assumption and try to find good features in predicting stocks trend in several days.
